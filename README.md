# Spectrum_RESTful

This is a take home assignment by Spectrum. The below are the project requirements were provided by Spectrum. 
```
This is a RESTful webservice implementation and using Spring Boot is a requirement:
ยง  A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction

(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

ยง  Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.

ยง  Make up a data set to best demonstrate your solution
```

This is a RESTAPI service to perform CRUD operations on a given note. Every note is a private resource to user who creates it and can perform Create, Update, Read or Delete.

> HTTP Method	Available URI	Summary
- POST	/notes	To create a notebook
- GET	/notes/{notebookName}	To get a specific notebook detail
- GET	/notes	To get the details of all the notebooks
- DELETE	/notes/{notebookName}	To delete a specific notebook
```

### URI Method summary

Example Model to create a new notebook using POST method and then use GET method to see the contents:

```
{
  "name": "string"
  "description": "string",
}
```
This API also provides the following resources mapped to the respective HTTP methods which supports CRUD operations for notes for a specified Notebook.

```
- POST	/notes/{noteName}/notes	To create a note in the specified notebook
- GET	/notes/{noteName}/notes/{title}	To get a specific note detail in the specified notebook
- GET	/notes/{noteName}/notes	To get all the notes associated to the specified notebook
- GET	/notes/{noteName}/{tag}	Given a notebook, get filtered list of notes that contain the given tag string
- PUT	/notes/{noteName}/notes/{title}	To update a specific note associated with the given notebook
- DELETE /notes/{noteName}/notes/{title}	To delete a specific note associated with the given notebook
```

Example model to create a POST method  
```
- {
 -  "title": "string",
  - "body": "string",
  - "tags": ["string", "string", "string"]
  - "createdTime": null,
  - "lastModified": null
}

```
Example model outputs the following using GET method
```
- "tags" - This is a string Array
- "createdTime" - This is set with the LocalDateTime value when a new note is created
- "lastModified" - This is set with the LocalDateTime value when a note is updated

```
